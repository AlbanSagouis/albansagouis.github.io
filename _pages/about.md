My name is Alban Sagouis and this is my personal professional website. My CV is here but I also plan to use the collection feature of this website to build a dynamic CV: I'll post blog posts about experiences I had that will be gathered together automatically.

I currently work at iDiv, the German Biodiversity Synthesis Center, as a Scientific programmer. In Jon Chase's group:
1. I extract, aggregate, restructure, check and standardise data from the literature
2. I assist team members with R problems
3. I implement and encourage scientific software reproducibility practices, notably containerisation and testing
4. I occasionaly build a package of functions used for a specific project such as the [sRealmTools][gh_srealmtools] package or [BioTIMEr][gh_biotimer]
5. I write monthly newsletters to my colleagues which you can find [here][link_to_tech_news]
6. I frequently talk about how indespensible is the [`renv`][renv] package



I used the template Minimal Mistake by Michael Rose and develop and build locally in Visual Studio Code. I wrote about this process in [a blog post][website_building_1]
