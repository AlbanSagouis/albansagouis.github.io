title: "How to build a website"

My name is Alban Sagouis and this is my first personal website.

I used the template Minimal Mistake by Michael Rose and develop and build locally in Visual Studio Code.

I use darktable to resize the pictures, scale down by specifying approximate target size in the export tool.
